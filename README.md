-Hello and welcome to City³! The penultimate City Gamemode for Eric Hartman's Blockland©, this gamemode hopes to offer as described below:
-

-	-Creates, manages, and facilitates a database (kept on file)
-	-Manages groups, their owner(s) and members, the day it was created, and days since creation, its group type (Corp, Gang, or Admin)
-	-Keeps track of individual users
-		-Records last date each citizen/user visited
-	-Creates a viewable 'map' (In GUI) based on "Road Plates" and Lots, via Commercial Residential Industrial or admin, possibly recognizes all other areas as terrain based on max height of brick
-	-Cities joinable through GUI, can see city's name (See GUI mockup)
-	-3 usable item slots, 3 backpack slots manageable through GUI (See GUI mockup)
-	-Attention to detail of the mod
-	-Trash cans which can hold 1 item after an item is thrown into it
-		-Shakes a little with a sound effect when item is 'thrown' into it (Ctrl+W)
-		-A user can recover the last item thrown into a trash can and add it to their inventory or backpack
-	-Resource gathering may have some sort of small skill involved
-		-Fishing may require good reaction time to a tug (with the model tugging a bit after clicking)
-	-Crimes can be "gotten" away with if there are no observers of the crime (or other criteria)
-	-Different criteria for all murders, a "dead body" is always found after some time, your suspicion level may rise randomly
-	-Gangs or the Police group can take people 'hostage' (Police needing warrant to handcuff someone) either with handcuffs or duct tape for Gangs
-	-Resources (food, ores, trees) can be processed into items or imported from other cities more cheaply, these resources can be exported and processed as well
-	-Cities listed in the GUI can be auto removed if corruption (cheating) is detected
-	-"Death" entails hospitalization which has a variable chance of coming out of the situation alive or dying in hospital care
-	-Certain "deaths" are automatic reset regardless of the hospital, and thus the mod needs to be able to track certain death types
-	-Hired "doctors" has a greater chance of healing you successfully, otherwise is a 50/50 chance with a hired foreign doctor
-	-Groups can "take over" the city.. maybe
-	-Admins, SAs, and the Host are all stripped of their in RP powers and have less of an impact on the gameplay than most cheating/corrupt servers.
